<p><strong>Passage 1</strong>
Stan Murch, in a uniform-like blue jacket, stood on the 21 <strong>__</strong><strong>__ in front of the Hilton and watched cab after cab make the loop into the 22</strong><strong>__</strong>__ entrance. Doesn’t anybody travel in their own car anymore? 
Then at last a Chrysler Imperial with Michigan plates came 23 <strong>__</strong><strong>__ up Sixth Avenue, made the left-hand loop into the Hilton 24 __</strong><strong>__</strong> and stopped at the entrance. As a woman and several children got out of the doors on the 25 <strong>__</strong><strong>__ of the car, toward the hotel entrance, the driver climbed 26</strong><strong>__</strong>__ out on the left. He was a big man with a cigar and a camel’s-hair 27<strong>__</strong><strong>__. 
Murch was at the door before it was 28 __</strong><strong>__ open, pulling it the rest of the way and saying, “Just leave the 29</strong><strong>__</strong> in, sir.”
“Right,” the man said around his cigar. He got out and sort of 30<strong>__</strong>__ himself inside the coat. Then, as Murch was about to get 31 <strong>__</strong><strong>__ the wheel, the driver said, “Wait.”
Murch looked at him, “Sir?”
“Here you go, boy,” the man said and pulled a 32 __</strong><strong>__</strong> dollar bill from his pants pocket and handed it across.
“Thank you, sir,” Murch said. He 33 <strong>__</strong>__ with a hand holding the dollar, climbed behind the wheel and 34 <strong>__</strong><strong>__ away.
He was smiling as he made the right turn into 53rd Street; it wasn’t every day a man gave you a tip for 35 __</strong><em>__</em> his car.</p>

<p><strong>Passage 2</strong>
A beautiful woman and a man were involved in a car 36 <strong>__</strong><strong>__. Both of their cars were badly 37 __</strong><strong>__</strong><em>, but neither of them were hurt.
    After they came out of their cars, the woman said, “So you’re a man. That’s 38 <strong>__</strong></em><strong>__<em>. I’ m a woman. Wow, just look at our cars! But we’re 39 __</em></strong><strong>__<em>. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be 40 __</em></strong><strong>___ and live together in 41 __</strong><strong>__</strong> for the rest of our days.”
    “Please,” the man replied,” Oh yes, I agree with you 42<strong>__</strong><strong>__<em>! This must be a sign from God!” The woman continued, “and look at this, here’s another 43 __</em></strong><strong>__<em>. My car is seriously damaged but this bottle of wine hasn’t 44 __</em></strong><strong>__<em>. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and 45 __</em></strong><strong>___ our good luck”. Then she handed the bottle to the man.
The man 46 __</strong><strong>__</strong> his head, opened it and drank 47 <strong>__</strong><strong>__ the bottle and then handed it back to the woman. The woman took the bottle and 48 __</strong><strong>__</strong>_ put the cap back on, and handed it back to the man.
    The man asked, “Aren’t you having 49 <strong>__</strong><strong>__?” The woman replied, “No, I think I’ll just wait for the 50 __</strong><strong>__</strong>_ to come…</p>
